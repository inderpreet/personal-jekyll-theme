## About

<p>Hi. I'm Inderpreet and I am an Electronics Engineer by Education and Profession. I am based out of Amritsar, India and work part-time at <a href="https://gndu.ac.in">GNDU</a> as an Assistant Professor in the Department Of Electronics Technology. I moonlight as a contributor-at-large at <a href="https://hackaday.com">Hack A Day</a> and round out the rest of my waking hours blogging and building cool stuff.</p>

<p>I get involved in a lot of trainings and seminars for promoting technologies every now and then. I am available for hire if you need a Designer for your Embedded Projects or trainings. I work with most of the technologies out there but am particularly effective with automation and IoT. </p>

<p>Please feel free to reach out if you think I can help. Thanks.</p>
